Variational-inference:

q is called the variational approximation to the posterior. The term variational is used because you pick the best q in Q -- the term derives from the "calculus of variations," which deals with optimization problems that pick the best function (in this case, a distribution q). You can see some tutorials: https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/tutorials/variational.html 
Here, I am sharing a code for an example in python.
